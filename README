    Customizing config.h:
Change LEVELS to the desired number of levels of your page tables. Larger values will slow down the program.
Change POBITS to the desired number of page offset bits on each address. Increasing this will increase the
size of the pages. Making POBITS too large will eventually restrict the number of layers you can possibly have.

    USE CASE:
A use case of this program is for the educational purpose of demonstrating how page table allocation and translating
works. One can demonstrate the relation of the size of the offset to the size of a page table using this program.

    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Jacob from lab at 2pm helped me figure out that alignment should be the same as size in posix_memalign
Jacob from lab at 2pm suggested to use memset to zero out page tables

    LIMITATIONS:
there is no way to make different pages have different sizes.
